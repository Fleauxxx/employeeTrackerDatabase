# 12 SQL: Employee Tracker

## My Task

Developers frequently have to create interfaces that allow non-developers to easily view and interact with information stored in databases. These interfaces are called **content management systems (CMS)**. Your assignment this week is to build a command-line application from scratch to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL.


## User Story

I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
